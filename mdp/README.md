At this stage, the best preparation is by doing [this MDP-bonus](../mdp-bonus).

# MDP: Markov Decision Process
Begin with reading the code of conduct and the problem description below, 
then follow the instructions presented thereafter.

# Code of conduct
* This lab work is individual
  * Any doubt/question should be discussed with TA in-person during lab session.
    Note that there is no online lab session.
* You may open any resources, including generative AI but it should be used sparingly.
  You are expected to write down the code yourself. 
  Do not copy paste code from the chatbot's responses.
* Breaking any rule above will **cancel all the labs** worth at least 21 points.
  Note that here, the burden of proving innocent is on the presumably offender (the student).
* Submit by either one of the two deadlines specified below. 
  * For those who attend the lab session in-person: 
    * Deadline: 19 Feb at 17:30 WIB (= 16:40 WIB + 50 minutes extra time)
    * By attending, we mean coming to the lab by 15:10 WIB,
      taking some reasonable break (eg for praying Asar),
      coming back, then spending the remaining time in the lab.
    * Make sure you get the signature `Attendance: OK` from TA on your PR for your attendance
  * For those who **do not** attend the lab session in-person: 
    * Deadline: 19 Feb at 16:40 WIB (at the end of the lab session)
  * Late submission will not be accepted.
