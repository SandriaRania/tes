# Figures
All figures, plots, graphs go here.
They are inserted in [this README.md](https://github.com/ctrlcsui/mrl25/blob/main/labs/slul/template-20250208/README.md).
Make sure you use relative paths when inserting figures in the README.md, eg `./fig/plot.png`.
Failure in doing so will result in some (reasonable) mark deduction.

Specify links to the plotted data stored externally, eg GDrive, OneDrive (ensure View acesss is set).
Do not put any data and experiment results here in the repo.
