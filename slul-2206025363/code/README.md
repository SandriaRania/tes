# Code
All Python code goes here, including the conda environment file to create a conda environment (for reproduction).
* Be modular.
* Explanation about how to reproduce or run the code should be written in main exposition in [this README](https://github.com/ctrlcsui/mrl25/blob/main/labs/slul/template-20250208/README.md).
* You may put some bash scripts if needed.
* Notebook (.pynb) files are not accepted (they if any, will be simply ignored).
